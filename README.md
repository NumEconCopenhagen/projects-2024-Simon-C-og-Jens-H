## Inaugural Project

This project models an exchange economy to analyze market dynamics, utility optimization, and equilibrium conditions using the `ExchangeEconomyClass`. The accompanying notebook demonstrates the model with detailed analysis and visualizations.

## Data Project

This project explores the sporting habits of adults in Denmark from 2014 to 2022, analyzing trends in sports participation and event attendance. The accompanying Python script and Jupyter notebook include data cleaning, merging, and analysis processes to uncover insights into the correlation between sports membership and event attendance.

## Model Project
This project examines the Overlapping Generations (OLG) model, focusing on how both an imposed tax on income and changes in population growth affect capital accummulation. The notebook and py-file provide both analytical and numerical solutions, along with further analysis and visualizations to illustrate the model's dynamics.

## Exam Project
For this exam, the coding in the .py file is done with the assistance of ChatGPT. 
Our entire notebook (.ipynb) is made by us including text, interpretation, intuition and references to our .py file with the exception of the code in problem 1.3, which is generated using ChatGPT.

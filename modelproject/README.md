Our Model is titles 'OLG Model with PAYG System' and examines the Overlapping Generations (OLG) model, solving it both analytically and numerically. 
The OLG model considers two groups in an economy.... young and old. Assumes that the entire young population is in the working force and none of the old are in the working force. 

We then introduce a social security system to the economy. Specicifically, we introduce a Pay-as-you-go system (PAYG), an intra-temporal social security system, where current young pay contributions as benefits to current old.
Such system is well-known in Western economies, but many PAYG systems have funding problems as aging population is a problem $(n<0)$ - as young/old-ratio falls

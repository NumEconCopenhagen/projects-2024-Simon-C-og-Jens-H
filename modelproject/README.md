Our model, titled "OLG Model with PAYG System," examines the Overlapping Generations (OLG) model analytically and numerically. The OLG model considers an economy with two groups: the young, who are all part of the workforce, and the old, who are not.

We introduce a Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) social security system where the current young pay contributions as benefits to the current old. This system, common in Western economies, faces funding issues due to aging populations (n < 0) and a declining young-to-old ratio. Our focus is on the effects of population growth changes on capital accumulation. Initially, we analyze the impact of a lump-sum tax on the young population within the PAYG system.

The results, which can be seen by running modelproject.ipynb, show that both numerical and analytical solutions yield the same steady-state value. We find a negative correlation between the size of the lump-sum tax, $\tau$, and the capital accumulation steady state - i.e., when the tax increases, the capital accumulation steady state decreases. Similarly, we find a positive correlation between population growth, $n$, and the steady-state value for capital accumulation.


Dependencies: Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
